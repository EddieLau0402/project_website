            <h3>Villas</h3>
            <p>A total of 7 Villas located along sunrise side of the island, separate one to other, facing the beach. Wake up to the first sun rays glinting off the Indian Ocean horizon, either while you relax in bed and admire the view through floor to ceiling windows, or from your sun terrace that is decked out with loungers.</p>
            <p>These idyllic villas offer 17 square metres of natural beauty and luxurious comforts.  Designed in tropical island style, a marine colour scheme reflects the seascape and is accented by handcrafted timber decorations.  Sleep in a sumptuous king size bed, dressed in the finest linens.  Open your wardrobe to find yoga mats, a mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities and a luggage rack.  The extensive bathroom has outdoor Maldivian shower.</p>
            <p>All villas are equipped with high-speed Wi-FI internet access, digital telephone lines, 42 inch LCDTV and DVD entertainment system. Bathroom amenities include thick, absorbent towels, make-up/shaving mirror, hair dryer, pure cotton robes and slippers, and superior quality bath toiletries. In-room safes, 100% cotton bed sheets, air conditioning, overhead fans, and non-alocaholic drinks from the mini bar add to the feeling of cool comfort in every villa.</p>
